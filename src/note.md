    Dear Professor Shamas, I hope this message finds you in great spirits. As I approach the end of my journey at Durham College, I wanted to take a moment to express my heartfelt gratitude for your outstanding guidance and support as a professor and mentor. Your classes have been truly transformative, blending education with inspiration. Your ability to explain complex concepts with such clarity and passion has significantly deepened my understanding of Object-Oriented Programming with Java, Flutter, and mobile development as a whole. Your engaging teaching style made learning not just enjoyable but also impactful. The knowledge and skills I have gained under your guidance will undoubtedly prove invaluable as I embark on my career. Beyond the technical skills, I have greatly appreciated your approachable nature and your unwavering support for students, both inside and outside the classroom. This has made a lasting impact on me, and I am sincerely grateful for the positive influence you’ve had on my academic and personal growth. While I may not have the opportunity to see you again after graduation, please know that your dedication as an educator has left an indelible impression on me. Thank you for being such an inspiring professor. I hope to carry the lessons I’ve learned from you throughout my career. Wishing you continued success in your teaching and all your future endeavors.
